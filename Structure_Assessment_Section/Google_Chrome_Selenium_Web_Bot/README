Remember that, the 'pdb_files' folder is where the files:
	-ranked_0.pdb
	-ranked_1.pdb
	-ranked_2.pdb
	-ranked_3.pdb
	-ranked_4.pdb
are copied to start the process.

In other words, leave the folder 'pdb_files' as it is, do not delete it, do not change its name.

The folder 'Google_Chrome_Selenium_Web_Bot' is created with the objective of doing a single pdb
or a small batch of pdbs calculation.


Step 1:
Please copy and paste the single or batch of pdbs you want to make the calculation of, in the folder 'pdb_files':

Step 2:
Open a terminal at: Modalpha/Bioinformatic_tools_Section/Google_Chrome_Selenium_Web_Bot (the folder in which you opened this README file)

Use the following template on your terminal:
python3 main.py --QMEAN true --PROSA true --MOLPROBITY true --PROCHECK true

The arguments of 'main.py' are QMEAN, PROSA, MOLPROBITY and PROCHECK

In the previous example we told the program to make the calculation for all of them with the string 'true'
If you do not want to calculate one of them please change it to 'false'

For example, if you do not want to calculate PROSA, the template would be the following:
python3 main.py --QMEAN true --PROSA false --MOLPROBITY true --PROCHECK true

In case you want to do it manually, here are the websites that were used:
QMEAN:      https://swissmodel.expasy.org/qmean/
ProsaWeb:   https://prosa.services.came.sbg.ac.at/prosa.php
MolProbity: http://molprobity.biochem.duke.edu/
Procheck:   https://saves.mbi.ucla.edu/

################################################################################

The output are new folders with the information of each calculation.
If you set all the arguments to 'true' you will see four new folders named:
-QMEAN
-Z_Score
-MOLPROBITY
-PROCHECK
Each folder contains a .csv file and a human readable file containing the result of the calculations.
Additionally there are screenshots for each pdb of the results obtained doing the calculations.
