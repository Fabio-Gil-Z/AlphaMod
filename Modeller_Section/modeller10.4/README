** DESCRIPTION:

  MODELLER is used for homology or comparative modeling of protein three-
  dimensional structures (1). The user provides an alignment of a sequence
  to be modeled with known related structures and MODELLER automatically 
  calculates a model containining all non-hydrogen atoms. MODELLER 
  implements comparative protein structure modeling by satisfaction of
  spatial restraints (2,3), and can perform many additional tasks, including
  de novo modeling of loops in protein structures, optimization of various
  models of protein structure with respect to a flexibly defined objective
  function, multiple alignment of protein sequences and/or structures,
  clustering, searching of sequence databases, comparison of protein
  structures, etc.
  MODELLER is written in Fortran-90 and is meant to run on UNIX, Windows,
  Linux and Apple systems.

** DISTRIBUTION:

  MODELLER is available free of charge to academic non-profit institutions
  from the MODELLER website (https://salilab.org/modeller/).

  For commercial or governmental licensing of MODELLER, please contact
  BIOVIA, 5005 Wateridge Vista Drive, San Diego, CA 92121, USA,
  email biovia.support@3ds.com, http://www.3dsbiovia.com/.



** REGISTRATION and INSTALLATION

  Please access the academic license server from the MODELLER website
  to apply for the MODELLER key. You will need this license key in order
  to run the MODELLER installer. See the file INSTALLATION for installation
  instructions.



** MODELLER USERS EMAIL LIST:

  In addition to the manual, you can receive help from the MODELLER 
  users email list. The archive of this list contains many tips about 
  using MODELLER. You can access it from the MODELLER website at
  https://salilab.org/modeller/ where you will find detailed instructions 
  on how to subscribe yourself. 



** GRAPHICAL INTERFACE:

  MODELLER runs via scripts written in the Python language, and does not provide
  any graphical interface. A graphical interface to MODELLER is available as
  part of BIOVIA's Discovery Studio interactive molecular modeling program,
  which also contains many other tools for protein modeling and structural
  analysis. This program facilitates preparation of input files for MODELLER
  (e.g. alignment file) as well as an analysis of the results (e.g., an
  evaluation of the models). If you are interested in this program, please
  contact BIOVIA at the address above.


** ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:

  Additional information about MODELLER can be obtained on our web site 
  https://salilab.org/.
