<LI><B>I want to build a model of a chimeric protein based on two 
known structures. Alternatively, I want to build a multi-domain protein 
model using templates corresponding only to the individual domains.</B>

<P>
This can be accomplished using the standard <TT>AutoModel</TT> class
(see Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node15.html#CHAPTERAUTOMODEL">2</A>).
The alignment should be as follows when the chimera is a 
combination of proteins A and B:

<P>
<PRE>
proteinA  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa----------------------------------
proteinB  ----------------------------bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb 
chimera   aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb
</PRE>

<P>
In the <TT>PIR</TT> format the alignment file is:

<P>
<PRE>
&gt;P1;proteinA
structureX:proteinA
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa----------------------------------*
&gt;P1;proteinB
structureX:proteinB
----------------------------bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb*
&gt;P1;chimera
sequence:chimera
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb*
</PRE>

<P>
If no additional information is available about the relative orientation 
of the two domains the resulting model will probably have an incorrect 
relative orientation of the two domains when the overlap between
A and B is non-existing or short. To obtain satisfactory
relative orientation of modeled domains in such cases, orient
the two template structures appropriately before the modeling.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>I don't want to use one region of a template for construction
of my model.</B>

<P>
The easiest way to achieve this is to not align that region of the template
with the target sequence. If region <TT>'bbbbbbbb'</TT> of the template should 
not be used as a template for region <TT>'eeeee'</TT> of the target sequence the 
alignment should be like this:

<P>
<PRE>
template  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-----bbbbbbbbcccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc
target    ddddddddddddddddddddddddeeeee--------ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
</PRE>

<P>
The effect of this alignment is that no homology-derived restraints will 
be produced for region <TT>'eeeee'</TT>.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>I want to explicitly force certain Pro residues to the 
<I>cis</I> <SPAN CLASS="MATH">&omega;</SPAN> conformation.</B>

<P>
M<SMALL>ODELLER</SMALL> should usually be allowed to handle this automatically 
<EM>via</EM> the omega dihedral angle restraints, which are calculated
by default.

<LI><B>How can I select/remove/add a set of restraints?</B>

<P>
Restraints can be read from a file by <B><A HREF="node227.html#CMD:Restraints.append">Restraints.append()</A></B><A NAME="4543"></A>, calculated 
by <B><A HREF="node215.html#CMD:Restraints.make">Restraints.make()</A></B><A NAME="4548"></A> or <B><A HREF="node216.html#CMD:Restraints.makedistance">Restraints.make_distance()</A></B><A NAME="4553"></A>,
or added &ldquo;manually&rdquo; by <B><A HREF="node223.html#CMD:Restraints.add">Restraints.add()</A></B><A NAME="4558"></A>.
<B><A HREF="node219.html#CMD:Restraints.pick">Restraints.pick()</A></B><A NAME="4563"></A> picks those restraints for objective function
calculation that restrain the selected atoms only.
The <TT>'AutoModel.homcsr()'</TT> routine contains examples 
of selecting atoms when generating restraints
by <B><A HREF="node216.html#CMD:Restraints.makedistance">Restraints.make_distance()</A></B><A NAME="4569"></A>. There are also commands
for adding and unselecting single restraints, <B><A HREF="node223.html#CMD:Restraints.add">Restraints.add()</A></B><A NAME="4574"></A> 
and <B><A HREF="node224.html#CMD:Restraints.unpick">Restraints.unpick()</A></B><A NAME="4579"></A>, respectively. If you do <B><A HREF="node222.html#CMD:Restraints.condense">Restraints.condense()</A></B><A NAME="4584"></A>, 
the unselected restraints will be deleted. This
is useful for getting rid of the unwanted restraints completely.

<LI><B>How do I define my own residue types, such as D-amino acids,

<P>
This is a painful area in all molecular modeling programs. However,
C<SMALL>HARMM</SMALL> and X-PLOR provide a reasonably straightforward solution
<EM>via</EM> the residue topology and parameter libraries. M<SMALL>ODELLER</SMALL> uses 
C<SMALL>HARMM</SMALL> topology and parameter library format and also extends the options
by allowing for a generic &ldquo;BLK&rdquo; residue type (Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node107.html#SECTION:block">5.2.1</A>). 
This BLK residue type circumvents the need for editing any library files,
but it is not always possible to use it. Due to its conformational
rigidity, it is also not as accurate as a normal residue 
type. In order to define a new residue type in the M<SMALL>ODELLER</SMALL> 
libraries, you have to follow the series of steps described below.
As an example, we will define the ALA residue without any hydrogen 
atoms. You can add an entry to the M<SMALL>ODELLER</SMALL> topology or parameter file; 
you can also use your own topology or parameter files. 
For more information, please see the C<SMALL>HARMM</SMALL> manual.

<P>
You can obtain an initial approximation to this entry by defining the new
residue type using the residue type editor in Q<SMALL>UANTA</SMALL> and then writing it
to a file.

<P>
The RESI record specifies the C<SMALL>HARMM</SMALL> residue name, which can be up to four
characters long and is usually the same as the PDB residue name (exceptions
are the potentially charged residues where the different charge states
correspond to different C<SMALL>HARMM</SMALL> residue types). The number gives the 
total residue charge.

<P>
The ATOM records specify the IUPAC (<EM>i.e.</EM>, PDB) atom names and the C<SMALL>HARMM</SMALL> atom 
types for all the atoms in the residue. The number at the end of each ATOM
record gives the partial atomic charge.

<P>
The BOND records specify all the covalent bonds between the atoms in the
residue (<EM>e.g.</EM>, there are bonds CB-CA, N-CA, O-C, etc.). In addition, 
symbol <TT>'+'</TT> is used to indicate the bonds to the subsequent residue in the 
chain (<EM>e.g.</EM>, C - +N). The covalent angles and dihedral angles are calculated 
automatically from the list of chemical bonds.

<P>
The IMPR records specify the improper dihedral angles, generally used
to restrain the planarity of various groups (<EM>e.g.</EM>, peptide bonds and 
sidechain rings). See also below.

<P>
The IC (internal coordinate) records are used for constructing
the initial Cartesian coordinates of a residue. An entry

<TT>'*'</TT>. As before, the <TT>'-'</TT> and <TT>'+'</TT> prefixes for the atom names select
the corresponding atom from the preceding and subsequent residues,
respectively. The distances are in angstroms, angles in degrees.
The distinction between the dihedral angles and 
improper dihedral angles is unfortunate since they are the
same mathematically, except that by convention when using the
equations, the order of the atoms for a dihedral angle is <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG

<P>
The PATC record specifies the default patching residue type when the
current residue type is the first or the last residue in a chain.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>You have to make sure that all the C<SMALL>HARMM</SMALL> atom types of the 
new residue type occur in the MASS records at the beginning
of the topology library: Add your entry at the end of the MASS list if
necessary. If you added any new C<SMALL>HARMM</SMALL> atom types, you also have to 
add them to the radii library, <TT>'modlib/radii.lib'</TT>
and to the solvation library, <TT>'modlib/solv.lib'</TT>.
The radii library lists the atomic radii for the 
different topology models, for the long range non-bonded
soft-sphere<A NAME="4616"></A> term. The full name of the file that is 
used during calculation is given by the environment variable <TT>$RADII_LIB</TT>.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Optionally, you can add the residue entry to the library of
M<SMALL>ODELLER</SMALL> topology models, <TT>'modlib/models.lib'</TT>. The runtime
version of this library is specified by the environment variable
<TT>$MODELS_LIB</TT>. This library specifies which subsets of atoms 
in the residue are used for each of the possible topologies.
Currently, there are 10 topologies selected by <I CLASS="sans"><A HREF="node164.html#MEMB:Topology.submodel">Topology.submodel</A></I><A NAME="4623"></A>

<P>
The residue entries in this library are separated by stars. The
<TT>'####'</TT> string indicates a missing atom. The atom names for the 
present atoms are arbitrary. The order of the atoms must be the same
as in the C<SMALL>HARMM</SMALL> residue topology library. If a residue type
does not have an entry in this library, all atoms are used for
all topologies.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>You have to add the new residue type to the residue type library,
<TT>'modlib/restyp.lib'</TT>. The execution version of this file is
specified by the environment variable <TT>$RESTYP_LIB</TT>. See the comments
in the file for further information.

<P>
Every residue in the C<SMALL>HARMM</SMALL> topology file has to have an entry 
in the <TT>$RESTYP_LIB</TT> library, but not every residue entry in the
<TT>$RESTYP_LIB</TT> library needs an entry in the residue topology file. If you
need to edit the <TT>$RESTYP_LIB</TT> file, it is recommended that you change
a copy of it, and provide that file to the <B><A HREF="node117.html#CMD:Environ">Environ()</A></B><A NAME="4636"></A> constructor.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>In general, when you add a new residue type, you also add new
chemical bonds, angles, dihedral angles, improper dihedral angles,
and non-bonded interactions,
new in the sense that a unique combination of C<SMALL>HARMM</SMALL> atoms types
is involved whose interaction parameters are not yet specified in the
parameter library (see also Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node107.html#SECTION:restopundefined">5.2.1</A>).
In such a case, you will get a number of
warning and/or error messages when you generate the stereochemical
restraints by the <B><A HREF="node215.html#CMD:Restraints.make">Restraints.make()</A></B><A NAME="4642"></A> command. These messages
can sometimes be ignored because M<SMALL>ODELLER</SMALL> will guess the 
values for the missing parameters<A NAME="4469"></A> from the
current Cartesian coordinates of the model. When this is not accurate
enough or if the necessary coordinates are undefined
you have to specify the parameters explicitly in the parameter 
library. Search for BOND, ANGL, DIHE, and IMPR sections in the 
parameters library file and use the existing entries to guess your
new entries. Note that you can use dummy atom types <TT>'X'</TT> to create
general dihedral (<EM>i.e.</EM>, <TT>X A A X</TT>) and improper dihedral angle (<EM>i.e.</EM>, 
<TT>A X X A</TT>) entries, where <TT>A</TT> stands for any of the real C<SMALL>HARMM</SMALL> 
atom types. 
For the dihedral angle cosine terms, the C<SMALL>HARMM</SMALL> convention for the phase
is different for 180&deg; from M<SMALL>ODELLER</SMALL>'s (Eq.&nbsp;<A HREF="node497.html#eq:cosine">A.84</A>).
If you use non-bonded Lennard-Jones<A NAME="4658"></A> terms, you also have
to add a NONB entry for each new atom type. If you use the default soft-sphere<A NAME="4659"></A> non-bonded restraints, you have already taken care of it by
adding the new atom types to the <TT>$RADII_LIB</TT> and <TT>$RADII_LIB</TT>
libraries.

</PRE>

<P>
The PRES record specifies the C<SMALL>HARMM</SMALL> patching residue name (up to 
four characters).

<P>
The ATOM records have the same meaning as for the RESI residue types
described above. The extension is that the IUPAC atom names (listed
first) must be prefixed by the index of the residue that is patched, if the
patch affects multiple residues.
In this example, there are two CYS residues that are patched, thus
the prefixes 1 and 2. When using the <B><A HREF="node188.html#CMD:Model.patch">Model.patch()</A></B><A NAME="4664"></A>
command, the order of the patched residues specified by <I CLASS="sans">residues</I><A NAME="4669"></A> 
must correspond to these indices (this is only important when the 
patch is not symmetric, unlike the <TT>'DISU'</TT> patch in this example).

<P>
DELETE records specify the atoms to be deleted, the two hydrogens bonded
to the two sulfurs in this case.

<P>
The BOND and IC (internal coordinate) records are the same as those for 
the RESI residues, except that the atom names are prefixed with the

<LI><B>Is it possible to restrain secondary structure in the

<P>
Yes &mdash; see Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node28.html#SECTION:model-addrsr">2.2.11</A> for an example.

<LI><B>I want to patch the N-terminal or (C-terminal) residue (<EM>e.g.</EM>,
to model acetylation properly), but the <B><A HREF="node188.html#CMD:Model.patch">Model.patch()</A></B><A NAME="4674"></A> command does not work.</B>

<P>
This is probably because the N-terminus is patched by default with
the NTER patching residue (corresponding to -NH3<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="17" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img27.png"
 ALT="$^+$"></SPAN>) and a patched 
residue must not be patched again. The solution is to turn the default 
patching off by <TT>env.patch_default = False</TT> before the 
<B><A HREF="node185.html#CMD:Model.generatetopology">Model.generate_topology()</A></B><A NAME="4679"></A> command is called.

<LI><B>Is it possible to use templates with the coordinates for

Yes. You do not have to do anything special.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>How do I analyze the output <TT>log</TT> file? <A NAME="FAQ:log"></A></B>

<P>
First, check for the error messages by searching for string
<TT>'_E&gt;''</TT>. These messages can only rarely be ignored. Next, check for the 
warning messages by searching for string <TT>'_W&gt;''</TT>. These messages
can almost always be ignored. If everything is OK so far, the most 
important part of the <TT>log</TT> file is the output of the <B><A HREF="node259.html#CMD:Selection.energy">Selection.energy()</A></B><A NAME="4689"></A>
command for each model. This is where the violations of
restraints are listed. When there are too many too violated restraints,
more optimization or a different alignment is needed. What is too many
and too much? It depends on the restraint type and is best learned by
doing <B><A HREF="node259.html#CMD:Selection.energy">Selection.energy()</A></B><A NAME="4694"></A> on an X-ray structure or a good model to get a
feel for it.
You may also want to look at the output of command <B><A HREF="node301.html#CMD:Alignment.check">Alignment.check()</A></B><A NAME="4699"></A>,
which should be self-explanatory. I usually ignore the other parts of the
<TT>log</TT> file.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>How do I prevent &ldquo;knots&rdquo; in the final models?</B>

<P>
The best way to prevent knots is to start with a starting 
structure that is as close to the desired final model as 
possible. Other than that, the only solution at this point is to calculate 
independently many models and hope that in some runs there won't 
be knots. Knots usually occur when one or more neighboring long 
insertions (<EM>i.e.</EM>, longer than 15 residues) are modeled from
scratch. The reason is that an insertion is built from a randomized
distorted structure that is located approximately between the two 
anchoring regions. Under such conditions, it is easy for the 
optimizer to &ldquo;fall&rdquo; into a knot and then not be able to recover from it.
Sometimes knots result from an incorrect alignment, especially when 
more than one template is used. When the alignment is correct,
knots are a result of optimization not being good enough.
However, making optimization more
thorough by increasing the CPU time would not be worth it on the 
average as knots occur relatively infrequently. The excluded 
volume restraints are already included in
standard comparative modeling with the <TT>AutoModel</TT> class
(see Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node15.html#CHAPTERAUTOMODEL">2</A>).

<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>What is considered to be the minimum length of a sequence motif
 necessary to derive meaningful constraints from the alignment to use in
 modeling.. one, two, three, or more?</B>

<P>
Usually more than that (dozens if you want just to detect reliable
similarity, and even more if you want a real model). 
It is good to have at least 35-40% sequence identity to build a model.
Sometimes even 30% is OK.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>Does Modeller have a graphical interface (GUI) ?</B>

<P>
No; Modeller is run from the command line, and uses a <A NAME="tex2html59"
  HREF="https://www.python.org/">Python</A> script to
direct it. Graphical interfaces to Modeller are commercially available
<A NAME="tex2html62"
  HREF="https://salilab.org/modeller/nonacademic.html">from BIOVIA</A>.
Also, check the <A NAME="tex2html63"
  HREF="https://salilab.org/modeller/wiki/Links">links page</A>
in the Modeller wiki for GUIs contributed by Modeller users.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>What do the &lsquo;Alignment sequence not found in PDB file&rsquo; or
&lsquo;Number of residues in the alignment and pdb files are different&rsquo; errors mean?</B>

<P>
When you give M<SMALL>ODELLER</SMALL> an alignment, it also needs to read the structure
of the known proteins (templates) from PDB files. In order to correctly match
coordinates to the residues specified in the alignment, the sequences in the
PDB file and the alignment file must be the same (although obviously you
can add gap or chain break characters to your alignment). If they are not,
you see this error. (Note that M<SMALL>ODELLER</SMALL> takes the PDB sequence from the
ATOM and HETATM PDB records, not the SEQRES records.) You should also check
the header of your alignment file, to make sure that you are reading the
correct chain and residue numbers from your PDB.

<P>
To see the sequence that M<SMALL>ODELLER</SMALL> reads from the PDB file <TT>'1BY8.pdb'</TT>,
use this short script to produce a <TT>'1BY8.seq'</TT> sequence file:
<PRE>
from modeller import *
env = Environ()
# If you also want to see HETATM residues, uncomment this line:
#env.io.hetatm = True
code = '1BY8'
mdl = Model(env, file=code)
aln = Alignment(env)
aln.append_model(mdl, align_codes=code)
aln.write(file=code+'.seq')
</PRE>

</LI>
<LI><B>Can I make a web interface or GUI for Modeller?</B>

<P>
Certainly, although you should bear in mind that the Modeller license is
non-transferable, and permits free usage only for academic purposes.

<P>
For web interfaces, users must obtain their own Modeller license key
<A NAME="tex2html64"
  HREF="https://salilab.org/modeller/registration.html">directly from us</A>;
your web interface should provide a text box into which users should
put their license key, and then use that input to set the
<TT>KEY_MODELLER10v4</TT> environment variable, as is done by our own
<A NAME="tex2html65"
  HREF="https://salilab.org/modweb/">M<SMALL>OD</SMALL>W<SMALL>EB</SMALL></A> and <A NAME="tex2html66"
  HREF="https://salilab.org/modloop/">M<SMALL>OD</SMALL>L<SMALL>OOP</SMALL></A> interfaces. (Note that you will first need to edit
the file <TT>modlib/modeller/config.py</TT> in your Modeller installation to remove
the line that sets the license, since this takes precedence over the
environment variable setting.)

<P>
For GUIs or other interfaces (<EM>e.g.</EM> frameworks), users should obtain and
license Modeller directly from us, rather than it being bundled with your
software.

<P>
In all cases, please update the <A NAME="tex2html67"
  HREF="https://salilab.org/modeller/wiki/Links">links page</A>
in the Modeller wiki, to advertise your software to Modeller users.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>I get warnings such as 'Could not find platform independent
libraries', 'import site failed' or 'No module named socket'</B>

<P>
These refer to missing Python modules on your system. In the first two cases,
these are just warnings that can be safely ignored - most Modeller scripts do
not need Python modules anyway, and will run successfully. However, some
Modeller scripts, such as the parallel task support, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">do</SPAN> need modules
(such as socket) and will not function without them. Please refer to the
<A NAME="tex2html68"
  HREF="https://salilab.org/modeller/release.html#issues">release notes</A>
for two possible solutions in this case.
