These scripts demonstrate the complete comparative modeling procedure, from
target sequence to models.

1) Finding structures related to the target sequence: search.py
 
2) Preparing initial family alignment of all structures and the target 
   sequence: compare.py

3) Becoming familiar with the family fold and improving the alignment: 
   use RASMOL, QUANTA, or INSIGHT; no script files here.

4) Modeling: get-model.py

5) Evaluating the models: use PROCHECK, QUANTA, INSIGHT, threading, etc.
   (no scripts for that here); GA341 assessment is done automatically in step 4.
