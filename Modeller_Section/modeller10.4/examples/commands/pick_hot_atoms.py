# Example for: Selection.hot_atoms()

# This will pick atoms violated by some restraints (bond length restraints
# here), select restraints operating on violated atoms, and calculate the
# energy for the selected restraints only (note that a list of violated
# restraints can be obtained by the ENERGY command alone).
